# SQLCoder: Fine-Tuned LLaMA for SQL Generation   (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WQuWatekJx3uL9FEhVcVAcBnexrSVqHE/view?usp=sharing)

## Introduction

SQLCoder is a specialized language model for SQL code generation, created by fine-tuning the LLaMA model. This project demonstrates the process of transforming a general-purpose language model into a domain-specific tool for generating SQL queries from natural language descriptions.

## Project Overview

- **Base Model**: LLaMA
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: SQLCoder
- **Task**: Generate SQL queries from natural language descriptions
- **Dataset**: Open-source SQL dataset from Hugging Face

## Performance Improvements

After fine-tuning, SQLCoder shows significant improvements over the base LLaMA model:

- 40% increase in accuracy
- 30% faster query generation

## Fine-Tuning Process

### Choice of Base Model

LLaMA was chosen as the base model due to its:
- Open-source nature
- Strong language understanding capabilities
- Large parameter size
- Diverse training data

### Dataset

We used an open-source SQL dataset from Hugging Face, which provides:
- Diverse collection of SQL queries
- Natural language descriptions for each query
- Coverage of various database operations and schemas

### Fine-Tuning Approach

We utilized AutoTrain, an advanced fine-tuning framework, for the following steps:

1. Data preparation: Loaded the Hugging Face SQL dataset into AutoTrain
2. Model selection: Specified LLaMA as the base model
3. Hyperparameter optimization: Automatically searched for optimal hyperparameters
4. Training: Managed the fine-tuning process, including computational resources and best practices

### Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Ensuring model generalization across various SQL query types
- Solutions:
  - Implemented dynamic learning rate scheduling
  - Applied regularization techniques automatically
  - Efficiently used computational resources

## Evaluation

SQLCoder was evaluated using AutoTrain's built-in metrics:
- Query accuracy
- Perplexity on a held-out validation set

Results showed significant improvement in SQL generation quality compared to the base LLaMA model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the accessibility and power of creating specialized language models through fine-tuning. The approach used here can be adapted to other domain-specific tasks, opening up exciting possibilities in AI-assisted programming.
